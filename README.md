# Computer games
This is a store, which sells computer games worldwide. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. I need to identify the patterns that determine a game's success. This will allow me to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.

I have data in front of me through 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and I'm planning a campaign for 2017. I need to work out how to work with the data. It doesn't matter if I'm forecasting sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or 2027 based on 2026 data.

In the data set comes the acronym ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), which is the association that determines the age rating of computer games. The ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, such as "For Adults," "For Young Children," or "For Teens."

My goals are:

1. Do an exploratory analysis of the data

Look at how many games were released in different years. Is data for all periods important?

Look at how sales varied by platform. Choose the platforms with the highest total sales and plot the distribution by year. Over what characteristic period do new platforms appear and old ones disappear?

Take the data for the relevant current period. Determine the relevant period on your own as a result of researching the previous questions. The main factor - this data will help to build a forecast for 2017.

Do not take into account data from previous years.

Which platforms are leading in sales, rising or falling? Pick a few potentially profitable platforms.

Construct a "mustache box" chart of global game sales by platform. Describe the result.

See how sales within one popular platform are affected by user and critical reviews. Construct a scatter plot and calculate the correlation between reviews and sales. Formulate conclusions.

Correlate the conclusions with game sales on other platforms.

Look at the overall distribution of games by genre. What can you say about the most profitable genres? Do the genres with high and low sales stand out?

2. Build a user profile for each region

Determine for the user of each region (NA, EU, JP):

The most popular platforms (top 5). Describe the differences in sales shares.

Most popular genres (top 5). Explain the differences.

Does the ESRB rating affect sales in an individual region?

3. Test the hypotheses.

The average user ratings for Xbox One and PC platforms are the same;

The average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different.
