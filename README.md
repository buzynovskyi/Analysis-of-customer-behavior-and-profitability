# Computer games
This is a store, which sells computer games worldwide. Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources. I need to identify the patterns that determine a game's success. This will allow me to bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.
I have data in front of me through 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and I'm planning a campaign for 2017. I need to work out how to work with the data. It doesn't matter if I'm forecasting sales for 2017 based on 2016 data or 2027 based on 2026 data.
In the data set comes the acronym ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board), which is the association that determines the age rating of computer games. The ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it an appropriate age category, such as "For Adults," "For Young Children," or "For Teens."
